# LOAN APPROVAL ANALYSIS

# Abstract
In our banking system, banks have many products to sell but main source of income of any banks is on its credit line. So they can earn from interest of those loans which they credits.A bank's profit or a loss depends to a large extent on loans i.e. whether the customers are paying back the loan or defaulting. By predicting the loan defaulters, the bank can reduce its Non- Performing Assets. This makes the study of this phenomenon very important. Previous research in this era has shown that there are so many methods to study the problem of controlling loan default. But as the right predictions are very important for the maximization of profits, it is essential to study the nature of the different methods and their comparison. A very important approach in predictive analytics is used to study the problem of predicting loan defaulters: The Logistic regression model. The data is collected from the Kaggle for studying and prediction. By using a logistic regression approach, the right customers to be targeted for granting loan can be easily detected by evaluating their likelihood of default on loan. 

# Introduction
Prediction of modernized loan approval system based on machine learning approach is a loan approval system from where we can know whether the loan will pass or not. In this system, we take some data from the user like his monthly income, marriage status, loan amount, loan duration, etc. Then the bank will decide according to its parameters whether the client will get the loan or not.So there is a classification system, in this system, a training set is employed to make the model and the classifier may classify the data items into their appropriate class. A test dataset is created that trains the data and gives the appropriate result that, is the client potential and can repay the loan. Prediction of a modernized loan approval system is incredibly helpful for banks and also the clients. This system checks the candidate on his priority basis. Customer can submit his application directly to the bank so the bank will do the whole process, no third party or stockholder will interfere in it. And finally, the bank will decide that the candidate is deserving or not on its priority basis.

# PROBLEM STATEMENT 
There is a company named Dream Housing Finance that deals in all home loans. They have presence across all urban, semi urban and rural areas. Customer first apply for home loan after that company validates the customer eligibility for loan.However doing this manually takes a lot of time. Hence it wants to automate the loan eligibility process (real time) based on customer informationSo the final thing is to identify the factors/ customer segments that are eligible for taking loan. How will the company benefit if we give the customer segments is the immediate question that arises. The solution is â€¦.Banks would give loans to only those customers that are eligible so that they can be assured of getting the money back. Hence the more accurate we are in predicting the eligible customers the more beneficial it would be for the Dream Housing Finance Company.

# Implementation
- Define the research question: Determine the research question you want to answer or the problem you want to solve.
- Exploring the dataset : A data set is a collection of related, discrete items of related data that may be accessed individually or in combination or managed as a whole entity.A data set is organized into sometype of data structure. For Loan Approval Analysis, we have used a dataset from Kaggle. The Dataset consists of Channel data collected over the years.
- Exploratory data analysis :  is an approach that is used to analyze the data and discover trends, patterns, or check assumptions in data with the help of statistical summaries and graphical representations. two types are -
Univariate: In univariate analysis, we analyze or deal with only one variable at a time. The analysis of univariate data is thus the simplest form of analysis since the information deals with only one quantity that changes. It does not deal with causes or relationships and the main purpose of the analysis is to describe the data and find patterns that exist within it.
Bi-Variate analysis : This type of data involves two different variables. The analysis of this type of data deals with causes and relationships and the analysis is done to find out the relationship between the two variables.
- Data cleaning : Data cleaning is the process that removes data that does not belong in your dataset. Data transformation is the process of converting data from one format or structure into another. Transformation processes can also be referred to as data wrangling, or data munging, transforming and mapping data from one "raw" data form into another format for warehousing and analyzing. This article focuses on the processes of cleaning that data
- Visualization : Data visualization is the representation of data through use of common graphics, such as charts, plots, infographics, and even animations. These visual displays of information communicate complex data relationships and data-driven insights in a way that is easy to understand.
- Train the model : Training a machine learning (ML) model is a process in which a machine learning algorithm is fed with training data from which it can learn. ML models can be trained to benefit businesses in numerous ways, by quickly processing huge volumes of data, identifying patterns, finding anomalies or testing correlations that would be difficult for a human to do unaided. ML algorithm used here is logistic regression.
