PROBLEM STATEMENT - 
There is a company named Dream Housing Finance that deals in all home loans. 
They have presence across all urban, semi urban and rural areas. Customer first apply for home loan after that company validates the customer eligibility for loan.
However doing this manually takes a lot of time. Hence it wants to automate the loan eligibility process (real time) based on customer information
So the final thing is to identify the factors/ customer segments that are eligible for taking loan. 
How will the company benefit if we give the customer segments is the immediate question that arises. 
The solution is â€¦.Banks would give loans to only those customers that are eligible so that they can be assured of getting the money back. 
Hence the more accurate we are in predicting the eligible customers the more beneficial it would be for the Dream Housing Finance Company.
